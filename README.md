# Codewars Problem Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various coding problems and exercises. It serves both as a record of my progress and
a way to practice coding in different languages, mainly **C** and **C++**.

## Structure

The repository is organized by language and then by problem.

## Notes

- All solutions are my own work.  
- Code is intended for learning and practice.  
- Memory management, readability, and correctness are emphasized for C/C++ solutions.
- Some solutions may differ from the original Codewars solutions in formatting and comments.
